== Installation ==

Download and activate the plugin on your WordPress Admin interface.
Add the API key generated on your Sprintcheckout Dashboard account under the "Get Paid" section in Woocommerce > Settings > Payments > Sprintcheckout configuration.
Connect your store on the Sprintcheckout Dashboard account under the "Fulfill" section.
Go to your store checkout page and test it. Enable the testnet of your choice on the Sprintcheckout Dashboard under the "Set up" section.

== Checkout experience ==

Your customers will be redirected to the app.sprintcheckout.com hosted payment page.
Users can connect any wallet.
They can pay in one of the supported tokens, and the amount is automatically converted from your store's fiat currency to the token.
Once paid, the order is sent to your WooCommerce back office, so you can deliver it to your customer.

== Pricing and gas ==

Sprintcheckout is totally free to install and use.
Sprintcheckout only charges a small service fee of 0.9% of the transaction amount.
The gas is paid by the user. Since we support rollups, the gas fees are minimal compared to Ethereum.
Within the coming months, Sprintcheckout will release Account Abstraction features that will enable gasless transactions.

== Vision ==

Sprintcheckout aims to provide bankless, fast, and cheap decentralized payment solutions for the next generations. Ethereum will evolve into the global settlement layer, while Rollups will serve as the scaling solution. Account Abstraction will enable the usability needed for mainstream adoption.

== Testing ==

You can test this plugin on the testnet, available on every supported network. Try it now!

== Try it now ==

The following store has installed the Sprintcheckout plugin. Try it when you checkout on Gripmonkeys.co.uk.

== Key Features & Highlights ==

Set it up in seconds, no KYC required.
Transaction fees are 10x cheaper than mainnet thanks to the Rollup scaling solution.
Customers can pay with the major stablecoins in the market using their preferred wallet.
The plugin is totally free. No monthly or annual fees.
== What are Rollups ==

Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. They allow for faster and cheaper transactions by executing them off-chain and then submitting the results to the Ethereum mainnet.

== What is Account Abstraction ==

Account abstraction (AA) is a promising technology that has the potential to make blockchain applications more secure, user-friendly, and flexible.
Gasless transactions are made possible by account abstraction. With gasless transactions, the user does not need to provide any ETH to pay for gas. Instead, the gas is paid for by Sprintcheckout.

== Supported Wallets ==

Customers can pay orders with Metamask extension, Coinbase, Formatic, Trust, Portis and the  <a href="https://registry.walletconnect.org/wallets">102 WalletConnect supported wallets</a> (including Argent, Huobi wallet, Metamask mobile,...).
